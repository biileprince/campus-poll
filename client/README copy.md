Quick start — run these in project root (C:\Users\BI-TECH\Components)

1. Install dependencies (required)
   npm install

2. Start dev server
   npm run dev

If you still see "'vite' is not recognized" after npm install:

- Try: npx vite
- Or install Vite globally (not recommended for CI): npm install -g vite

Notes:

- Ensure Node.js (>=16) and npm are installed.
- If Tailwind utilities don't appear, restart the dev server after editing tailwind.config.js or src/index.css.
